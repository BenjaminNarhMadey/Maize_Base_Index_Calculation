Maize Base Index (I) Calculation App

Welcome to the Maize Base Index (I) Calculation App repository! This Shiny app is a powerful tool designed for academic researchers and scientists in the field of plant genetics, genomics, and plant science. The app enables you to calculate the Base Index (I) for different water regimes in maize drought experiments, based on specified input values for various traits.

Features:
- Enter trait values such as Grain Yield, EPP (Environmental Productivity Potential), ASI (Anthesis Silking Interval), STYG (Stay-Green Trait Yield Gap), PASP (Post Anthesis Stay-Green Potential), and EASP (Early Anthesis Stay-Green Potential).
- Select from Well-Watered, Drought-Stressed, and Combined watering regimes.
- Calculate and visualize the Base Index (I) for different regimes.
- Enforce value limitations to ensure scientific validity.
- Easily reset inputs and selections.

Developed by the Maize Breeding Team at the West Africa Center for Crop Improvement (WACCI), University of Ghana.
